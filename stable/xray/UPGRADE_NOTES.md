# JFrog Xray Chart Upgrade Notes
This file describes special upgrade notes needed at specific versions

## Upgrade from 1.x to 2.X (Chart Versions)

* To upgrade from a version prior to 1.x, you first need to upgrade to latest version of 1.x as described in https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/xray/CHANGELOG.md.

**DOWNTIME IS REQUIRED FOR AN UPGRADE!**
* PostgreSQL sub chart was upgraded to version `8.x.x`. This version is not backward compatible with the old version (`0.9.5`)!
* MongoDB sub chart was upgraded to version `7.x.x`. This version is not backward compatible with the old version (`2.0.5`)!
* Note the following **PostgreSQL** Helm chart changes
  * The chart configuration has changed! See [values.yaml](values.yaml) for the new keys used
  * **PostgreSQL** is deployed as a StatefulSet
  * See [PostgreSQL helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/postgresql) for all available configurations
* Upgrade
  * Due to breaking changes in the **PostgreSQL** Helm chart, a migration of the database is needed from the old to the new database
  * The recommended migration process has 2 Main steps 1.Full DB export and import of MongoDB 2.Full DB export and import of Postgresql
    * Upgrade steps:
      1. Prerequisite step to get details of existing chart\
       a. Block user access to Xray (do not shutdown).\
       b. Obtain the service names (OLD_PG_SERVICE_NAME, OLD_MONGO_SERVICE_NAME) using below command\
          Example: OLD_PG_SERVICE_NAME and OLD_MONGO_SERVICE_NAME values are `<OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-postgresql` and `<OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-mongodb` respectively
          ```bash
          $ kubectl get svc
          NAME                                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                       AGE
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-mongodb                 ClusterIP      10.101.56.69     <none>        27017/TCP                     114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-postgresql              ClusterIP      10.101.250.74    <none>        5432/TCP                      114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-rabbitmq-ha             ClusterIP      None             <none>        15672/TCP,5672/TCP,4369/TCP   114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-rabbitmq-ha-discovery   ClusterIP      None             <none>        15672/TCP,5672/TCP,4369/TCP   114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-analysis           ClusterIP      10.104.138.63    <none>        7000/TCP                      114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-indexer            ClusterIP      10.106.72.163    <none>        7002/TCP                      114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-persist            ClusterIP      10.103.20.33     <none>        7003/TCP                      114m
          <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-server             LoadBalancer   10.105.121.175   <pending>     80:32326/TCP                  114m
         ```
         c. Keep the previous passwords (OLD_PG_PASSWORD, OLD_MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD) or Extract them from the secret of the existing postgresql and mongoDB pods
          Example: 
          ```bash
          OLD_PG_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n <namespace> <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgres-password}" | base64 --decode)
          OLD_MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n <namespace> <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-mongodb -o jsonpath="{.data.mongodb-root-password}" | base64 --decode)
          ```
         d. Stop old Xray pods (scale down replicas to 0). Postgresql and MongoDB pods still exists
          ```bash
          $ kubectl scale statefulsets <REPLACE_OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-rabbitmq-ha <REPLACE_OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-analysis <REPLACE_OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-indexer <REPLACE_OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-persist <REPLACE_OLD_RELEASE_NAME>-xray-server --replicas=0
          ```
      2. Run the `helm install`  with the `new version` say `xray-new` with Xray scale down replicas to 0, Both new Postgresql and MongoDB pods starts
          Example:
          ```bash
          helm install xray-new --set server.replicaCount=0,indexer.replicaCount=0,persist.replicaCount=0,analysis.replicaCount=0,rabbitmq-ha.enabled=false jfrog/xray
          ```
      3. To Migrate MongoDB data between old and new pods\
          a. Connect to the new MongoDB pod (you can obtain the name by running kubectl get pods)
           ```bash
           $ kubectl exec -it <NAME> bash
           ```
          b. Once logged in, create a dump file from the previous database using mongodump, connect to previous Mongodb chart:\
           ```bash
           $ mongodump -h <OLD_MONGO_SERVICE_NAME> -u root -o /tmp/dump
           ```
          c. After you ran above command you should be prompted for a password, this password is the previous chart password (OLD_MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD). This operation could take some time depending on the database size.\
          d. Once you have the backup file, you can restore it with a command like the one below:\
            ```bash
            $ mongorestore -u root /tmp/dump
            ```
          e. After run above command you should be prompted for a password, this is current chart MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD password.This operation could  take some time depending on the database size.
      4. To Migrate Postgresql data between old and new pods\
          a. Connect to the new PostgreSQL pod (you can obtain the name by running kubectl get pods)
           ```bash
           $ kubectl exec -it <NAME> bash
           ```
          b. Once logged in, create a dump file from the previous database using pg_dump, connect to previous postgresql chart:\
           ```bash
           $ pg_dump -h <OLD_PG_SERVICE_NAME> -U xray DATABASE_NAME > /tmp/backup.sql
           ```
          c. After you ran above command you should be prompted for a password, this password is the previous chart password (OLD_PG_PASSWORD). This operation could take some time depending on the database size.\
          d. Once you have the backup file, you can restore it with a command like the one below:\
            ```bash
            $ psql -U xray DATABASE_NAME < /tmp/backup.sql
            ```
          e. After run above command you should be prompted for a password, this is current chart password.This operation could  take some time depending on the database size.
      5. Run the Upgrade final time which would start xray with `databaseUpgradeReady=true` \
         Example :
         ```bash
         helm upgrade --install xray-new --set server.replicaCount=1,indexer.replicaCount=1,persist.replicaCount=1,analysis.replicaCount=1,rabbitmq-ha.enabled=true,databaseUpgradeReady=true jfrog/xray
         ```
      6. Restore access to new Xray
      7. Run `helm delete <OLD_RELEASE_NAME>` which will remove remove old Xray deployment and Helm release.
    * Xray should now be ready to get back to normal operation
