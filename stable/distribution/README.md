# JFrog Distribution Helm Chart

**Heads up: Our Helm Chart docs are moving to our main documentation site. For Distribution installers, see [Installing Distribution](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Distribution).**

## Prerequisites Details

* Kubernetes 1.12+

## Chart Details
This chart does the following:

* Deploy PostgreSQL database.
* Deploy Redis.
* Deploy distribution.

## Requirements
- A running Kubernetes cluster
- Dynamic storage provisioning enabled
- Default StorageClass set to allow services using the default StorageClass for persistent storage
- A running Artifactory Enterprise Plus
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed and setup to use the cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v2 or v3 installed

## Installing the Chart

### Add JFrog Helm repository

Before installing JFrog helm charts, you need to add the [JFrog helm repository](https://charts.jfrog.io) to your helm client.

```bash
helm repo add jfrog https://charts.jfrog.io
helm repo update
```

### Install Chart

#### Artifactory Connection Details
In order to connect Distribution to your Artifactory installation, you have to use a Join Key, hence it is *MANDATORY* to provide a Join Key and Jfrog Url to your Distribution installation. Here's how you do that:

Retrieve the connection details of your Artifactory installation, from the UI - https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/General+Security+Settings#GeneralSecuritySettings-ViewingtheJoinKey. 

#### Initiate Installation
Provide join key and jfrog url as a parameter to the Distribution chart installation:

```bash
helm upgrade --install distribution --set distribution.joinKey=<YOUR_PREVIOUSLY_RETIREVED_JOIN_KEY> \
             --set distribution.jfrogUrl=<YOUR_PREVIOUSLY_RETIREVED_BASE_URL> --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```

Alternatively, you can create a secret containing the join key manually and pass it to the template at install/upgrade time.
```bash
# Create a secret containing the key. The key in the secret must be named join-key
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=join-key=<YOUR_PREVIOUSLY_RETIREVED_JOIN_KEY>
# Pass the created secret to helm
helm upgrade --install distribution --set distribution.joinKeySecretName=my-secret --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```
**NOTE:** In either case, make sure to pass the same join key on all future calls to `helm install` and `helm upgrade`! This means always passing `--set distribution.joinKey=<YOUR_PREVIOUSLY_RETIREVED_JOIN_KEY>`. In the second, this means always passing `--set distribution.joinKeySecretName=my-secret` and ensuring the contents of the secret remain unchanged.

### Special Upgrade Notes
Distribution upgrade from 1.x to 2.x (App Version) is not directly supported. For manual upgrade, Please refer [here](https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/distribution/UPGRADE_NOTES.md). If this is an upgrade over an existing Distribution 2.x (App Version), explicitly pass `--set unifiedUpgradeAllowed=true` to upgrade.

### System Configuration
Distribution uses a common system configuration file - `system.yaml`. See [official documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System+YAML+Configuration+File) on its usage.

### Deploying Distribution for small/medium/large installations
In the chart directory, we have added three values files, one for each installation type - small/medium/large. These values files are recommendations for setting resources requests and limits for your installation. The values are derived from the following [documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/EP/Installing+on+Kubernetes#InstallingonKubernetes-Systemrequirements). You can find them in the corresponding chart directory -  values-small.yaml, values-medium.yaml and values-large.yaml

### Accessing Distribution
**NOTE:** It might take a few minutes for Distribution's public IP to become available, and the nodes to complete initial setup.
Follow the instructions outputted by the install command to get the Distribution IP and URL to access it.

### Updating Distribution
Once you have a new chart version, you can update your deployment with
```bash
helm upgrade distribution jfrog/distribution
```

If distribution was installed without providing a value to redis.password (a password was autogenerated), follow these instructions:
1. Get the current password by running:
```bash
REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n <namespace> <myrelease>-redis-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
```
2. Upgrade the release by passing the previously auto-generated secret:
```bash
helm upgrade <myrelease> jfrog/distribution --set redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
```

Alternatively, you can create a secret  which is required to have a key with the name `redis-password` and pass it to the template at install/upgrade time.
```bash
# Create a secret containing the redis password. The key in the secret must be named redis-password
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=redis-password=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
# Pass the created secret to helm
helm upgrade --install distribution --set redis.existingSecret=my-secret --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```

If distribution was installed without providing a value to postgresql.postgresqlPassword (a password was autogenerated), follow these instructions:
1. Get the current password by running:
```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n <namespace> <myrelease>-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode)
```
2. Upgrade the release by passing the previously auto-generated secret:
```bash
helm upgrade <myrelease> jfrog/distribution --set postgresql.postgresqlPassword=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
```

### Create a unique Master Key
JFrog Distribution requires a unique master key to be used by all micro-services in the same cluster. By default the chart has one set in values.yaml (`distribution.masterKey`).

**This key is for demo purpose and should not be used in a production environment!**

You should generate a unique one and pass it to the template at install/upgrade time.
```bash
# Create a key
export MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
echo ${MASTER_KEY}

# Pass the created master key to helm
helm upgrade --install distribution --set distribution.masterKey=${MASTER_KEY} --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution

Alternatively, you can create a secret containing the master key manually and pass it to the template at install/upgrade time.
```bash

# Create a secret containing the key. The key in the secret must be named master-key
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=master-key=${MASTER_KEY}

# Pass the created secret to helm
helm upgrade --install distribution --set distribution.masterKeySecretName=my-secret --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```
**NOTE:** In either case, make sure to pass the same master key on all future calls to `helm install` and `helm upgrade`! In the first case, this means always passing `--set -n distribution.masterKey=${MASTER_KEY}`. In the second, this means always passing `--set -n distribution.masterKeySecretName=my-secret` and ensuring the contents of the secret remain unchanged.
```

### High Availability
JFrog Distribution can run in High Availability by having multiple replicas of the Distribution service.

To enable this, pass replica count to the `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands.
```bash
# Run 3 replicas of the Distribution service
helm upgrade --install distribution --set replicaCount=3 --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```

### External Database

**For production grade installations it is recommended to use an external PostgreSQL with a static password**

There is an option to use an external PostgreSQL database for your Distribution.

To use an external **PostgreSQL**, You need to set the Distribution **PostgreSQL** connection details
```bash
export POSTGRES_URL=
export POSTGRES_USERNAME=
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

helm upgrade --install distribution \
    --set database.url=${POSTGRES_URL} \
    --set database.user=${POSTGRES_USERNAME} \
    --set database.password=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} \
    --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```
**NOTE:** The Database password is saved as a Kubernetes secret


#### Use existing secrets for PostgreSQL connection details
You can use already existing secrets for managing the database connection details.

Pass them to the install command like this
```bash
export POSTGRES_USERNAME_SECRET_NAME=
export POSTGRES_USERNAME_SECRET_KEY=
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME=
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY=

helm upgrade --install distribution \
    --set database.secrets.user.name=${POSTGRES_USERNAME_SECRET_NAME} \
    --set database.secrets.user.key=${POSTGRES_USERNAME_SECRET_KEY} \
    --set database.secrets.password.name=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME} \
    --set database.secrets.password.key=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY} \
    --namespace distribution jfrog/distribution
```

## Upgrade
Upgrading Distribution is a simple helm command
```bash
helm upgrade distribution jfrog/distribution
```

**NOTE:** Check for any version specific upgrade nodes in [CHANGELOG.md]

### Non compatible upgrades
In cases where a new version is not compatible with existing deployed version (look in CHANGELOG.md) you should
* Deploy new version along side old version (set a new release name)
* Copy configurations and data from old deployment to new one (/var/opt/jfrog)
* Update DNS to point to new Distribution service
* Remove old release

## Logger sidecars
This chart provides the option to add sidecars to tail various logs from Distribution containers. See the available values in `values.yaml`

 Get list of containers in the pod
```bash
kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE> <POD_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}' | tr ' ' '\n'
```

 View specific log
```bash
kubectl logs -n <NAMESPACE> <POD_NAME> -c <LOG_CONTAINER_NAME>
```

### Establishing TLS and Adding certificates
Create trust between the nodes by copying the ca.crt from the Artifactory server under $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/access/keys to of the nodes you would like to set trust with under $JFROG_HOME/<product>/var/etc/security/keys/trusted. For more details, Please refer [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing+TLS+Certificates).

Note: Support for custom certificates using secrets was added from 7.4.x chart versions

Tls certificates can be added by using kubernetes secret. The secret should be created outside of this chart and provided using the tag `.Values.distribution.customCertificates.certificateSecretName`. Please refer the example below.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic ca-cert --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt
```

And then pass it to the helm installation

```yaml
distribution:
  customCertificates:
    enabled: true
    certificateSecretName: ca-cert
router:
  tlsEnabled: true  
```

Note:
* `router.tlsEnabled` is set to true to add HTTPS scheme in liveness and readiness probes.

## Custom init containers
There are cases where a special, unsupported init processes is needed like checking something on the file system or testing something before spinning up the main container.

For this, there is a section for writing a custom init container in the [values.yaml](values.yaml). By default it's commented out
```
distribution:
  ## Add custom init containers
  customInitContainers: |
    ## Init containers template goes here ##
```

### Custom volumes
There are cases where you'd like custom files mounted onto your container's file system.

For this, there is a section for defining custom volumes in the [vaules.yaml](values.yaml).  By default they are left empty.
You can mount custom volumes onto both distribution pods like so:
```
common:
  ## Add custom volumes
  customVolumes: |
  #  - name: custom-script
  #    configMap:
  #      name: custom-script

distribution:
  ## Add custom volumeMounts
  customVolumeMounts: |
  #  - name: custom-script
  #    mountPath: "/scripts/script.sh"
  #    subPath: script.sh
```
